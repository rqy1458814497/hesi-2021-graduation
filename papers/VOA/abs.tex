Vertex algebras are algebraic structures that describe
the local data of a 2d chiral conformal field theory,
and its global data is described by conformal blocks.
Some conformal field theories arise as
chiral deformations of other theories,
and this construction corresponds
to the BRST reduction of a vertex algebra.
In this paper,
we propose a method of constructing families of
elements of the genus $1$ conformal block
for the BRST reduction of a vertex algebra.
This method is based on the technique of
regularized integrals of meromorphic forms on Riemann surfaces,
recently developed by Li and Zhou \cite{regularized}.
We show that
for an element of the conformal block,
its regularized integral against the BRST operator
gives an element of the conformal block
for the BRST reduction.
This provides a universal method of
constructing elements of BRST twisted conformal blocks geometrically.
