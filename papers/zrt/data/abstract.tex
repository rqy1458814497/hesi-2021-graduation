The explicit construction of Ricci-flat metric on Calabi--Yau manifolds has been an important question long since. On some special Calabi--Yau manifolds, asymptotics using semi-flat metrics have some well results. We'll introduce some results of Hein on constructing and estimating semi-flat metrics on rational elliptic surfaces in this paper. The main reference is Hein's paper \cite{hein2012gravitational}.
