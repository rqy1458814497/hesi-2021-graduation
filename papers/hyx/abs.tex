This paper is about Maryam Mirzakhani’s work in \emph{Simple geodesics and Weil-Petersson volumes of moduli spaces of bordered Riemann surfaces}, Invent. Math. 167 (2007), 179–222 and  \emph{Growth of the number of simple closed geodesics on hyperbolic surfaces}，Ann. of Math. 168 (2008), 97–125. The main conclusions are a generalizable method to calculate the Weil--Petersson volume of the moduli space of Riemann surfaces, and the asymptotic behavior of the number of simple closed geodesics with bounded length   on a given Riemann surface.
