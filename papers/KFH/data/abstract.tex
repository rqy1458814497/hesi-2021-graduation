\begin{abstract}
  We survey on the algebraic construction and the geometric construction of 
  standard modules of quiver Hecke algebras where the quiver is of finite type and the 
  ground field is of characteristic zero, and show that the two constructions
  are equivalent. These modules categorify the PBW basis of the Lusztig's
  twisted bialgebra $\f$. We also show that under this situation, the category of 
  finitely generated graded modules over a quiver Hecke algebra
  is a polynomial highest weight category.
